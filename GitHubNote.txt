% How to add it to GitHub????

% Does it appear now?

% Two steps: 1) view and sumbit changes; 2)Push to origin.

% So after I make an adjustment, I cannot push directly? I must push again in GitHub software?
% Seemed so.

% After I rename test to GitHubTestNote, the original file does not disapper?!

% So, how it work is, after you are done with adjustment, 
    % 1) click view and submit changes; 
    % 2) push it to GitHub desk; 
    % 3) from GitHub desk push to the oriin.
